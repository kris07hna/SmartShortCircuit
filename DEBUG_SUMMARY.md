## 🚀 How to Use Debug Features

### **1. ESP32 Serial Monitor Debugging:**
```bash
# Start monitoring
pio device monitor --baud 115200

# Watch for these debug messages:
=== Firebase Debug Info ===
Database URL: https://your-project.firebaseio.com/
Auth Token Length: 0
WiFi Status: Connected
Free Heap: 234532
Testing Firebase connection...
✅ Firebase connection successful!
```

### **2. Web Dashboard Debugging:**
1. **Open your website:** http://localhost:8000
2. **Click "🔍 Debug" button** (bottom-right corner)
3. **Watch real-time logs** in the debug panel
4. **Check browser console** (F12) for additional info

### **3. Firebase Console Monitoring:**
- Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
- Check your project → Realtime Database
- Watch for real-time data updates under `/latest/`

## 🚨 Common Debug Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: ESP32 Shows "Cloud - Error - Check Serial"**
**What to check:**
```
Serial Monitor Output:
❌ Firebase connection failed!
HTTP Code: 401
Error Reason: Unauthorized

Solution: Check Firebase auth token or database rules
```

### **Scenario 2: Web Dashboard Shows "Demo Mode"**
**What this means:**
- No real Firebase data detected
- Using simulated data for testing
- Check if ESP32 is uploading successfully

### **Scenario 3: Upload Statistics in Serial Monitor**
```
📊 Firebase Upload Statistics:
   Successful: 8
   Failed: 2  
   Success Rate: 80%
   Avg Upload Time: 245ms
```
