## 📐 Hardware Wiring

### **Correct INA219 Connections:**
```
INA219 Pin    →    ESP32 Pin    →    Description
VCC           →    3.3V         →    Power supply
GND           →    GND          →    Ground
SCL           →    GPIO 22      →    I2C Clock
SDA           →    GPIO 21      →    I2C Data
VIN+          →    [CIRCUIT+]   →    Positive side of circuit to monitor
VIN-          →    [CIRCUIT-]   →    Negative side of circuit to monitor
```

### **Important Wiring Notes:**
- ✅ **Use 3.3V, NOT 5V** for VCC (ESP32 is 3.3V logic)
- ✅ **Keep wires short** for I2C connections (< 20cm)
- ✅ **Use proper gauge wire** for VIN+/VIN- based on current
- ✅ **Double-check polarity** - wrong polarity can damage the sensor

## ⚙️ INA219 I2C Address Configuration

### **Default Address:** 0x40

### **Change Address with Solder Bridges:**
```
A1    A0    Address
GND   GND   0x40 (default)
GND   VCC   0x41
VCC   GND   0x44  
VCC   VCC   0x45
```

### **Check Current Address:**
The code automatically detects and displays the address in serial monitor.

## 🔍 Testing Your INA219 Setup

### **Step 1: Basic Connection Test**
Upload the code and check serial monitor for:
```
INA219 found at default address 0x40
INA219 initialized successfully. Test voltage: 12.34V
Shunt Voltage: 0.12 mV
Bus Voltage: 12.34 V
Current: 123.45 mA
```

### **Step 2: No Load Test**
**Expected readings with no load connected:**
- **Voltage:** Should match your power supply voltage
- **Current:** Should be close to 0mA (±1mA is normal)
- **Power:** Should be close to 0W

### **Step 3: Known Load Test**
**Connect a known resistor (e.g., 10Ω, 1W) and verify:**
- **Voltage:** Should remain stable
- **Current:** Should match V/R calculation
- **Power:** Should match V²/R calculation

**Example with 12V supply and 10Ω resistor:**
- Expected Current: 12V ÷ 10Ω = 1.2A
- Expected Power: 12V × 1.2A = 14.4W

## 📊 Reading Interpretation

### **Understanding the Measurements:**

#### **Bus Voltage (V):**
- Voltage on the load side (VIN+ to GND)
- This is the voltage your circuit receives
- Should be stable under normal conditions

#### **Shunt Voltage (mV):**
- Voltage drop across internal shunt resistor
- Used internally to calculate current
- Typically very small (few millivolts)

#### **Current (A):**
- Actual current flowing through the circuit
- Positive = current flowing from VIN+ to VIN-
- Negative = reverse current flow

#### **Power (W):**
- Calculated as Voltage × Current
- Total power consumed by your circuit
- Useful for energy monitoring

## ⚡ Short Circuit Detection Configuration

### **Current Threshold:**
```cpp
const float CURRENT_THRESHOLD = 3.0; // Adjust based on normal operating current
```
**How to set:**
1. Measure normal operating current
2. Set threshold 20-50% above normal
3. Too low = false alarms, too high = missed events

### **Voltage Drop Threshold:**
```cpp
const float VOLTAGE_DROP_THRESHOLD = 8.0; // Adjust based on expected voltage under load
```
**How to set:**
1. Measure voltage under normal load
2. Set threshold 10-20% below normal
3. Account for voltage sag under heavy load

### **Power Threshold:**
```cpp
const float POWER_THRESHOLD = 50.0; // Maximum expected power in Watts
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue 1: "INA219 sensor not found"**
**Possible Causes & Solutions:**
- ✅ Check wiring: SDA=21, SCL=22, VCC=3.3V, GND=GND
- ✅ Verify I2C address (try 0x41, 0x44, 0x45)
- ✅ Check for short circuits on I2C lines
- ✅ Try different jumper wires
- ✅ Ensure ESP32 is powered properly

### **Issue 2: Readings are unstable/noisy**
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Add 100nF capacitor between VCC and GND
- ✅ Keep I2C wires short and twisted
- ✅ Move away from switching power supplies
- ✅ Use moving average filtering (already implemented)

### **Issue 3: Current readings always show 0**
**Possible Causes:**
- ✅ No current actually flowing (check your circuit)
- ✅ VIN+ and VIN- not connected properly
- ✅ Current below sensor resolution
- ✅ Wrong calibration for your current range

### **Issue 4: Voltage readings are wrong**
**Possible Causes:**
- ✅ Measure actual voltage with multimeter to compare
- ✅ Check if using different ground references
- ✅ Verify VIN+ connection to positive supply

### **Issue 5: False short circuit alerts**
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Increase `CURRENT_THRESHOLD` value
- ✅ Check for power supply current spikes
- ✅ Add debouncing (already implemented)
- ✅ Verify your circuit doesn't have transient loads

## 🔬 Advanced Calibration

### **For Maximum Precision:**

#### **1. Measure Shunt Resistance:**
```cpp
// If you know the exact shunt resistance, you can calculate precise calibration
float shuntResistance = 0.1; // ohms (typical value, measure for precision)
```

#### **2. Custom Calibration:**
```cpp
// Advanced users can create custom calibration
// See Adafruit INA219 library documentation for details
```

#### **3. Temperature Compensation:**
The INA219 has some temperature drift. For critical applications:
- Use temperature sensor for compensation
- Calibrate at operating temperature
- Consider environmental factors

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### **Sampling Rate:**
- Default: ~2-3 samples per second
- Can be increased to ~10-20 samples per second
- Higher rates may increase noise

### **Filtering:**
The code includes a 5-point moving average filter:
```cpp
// Increases stability but adds slight delay
// Good balance between speed and accuracy
```

### **Update Intervals:**
```cpp
const unsigned long UPDATE_INTERVAL = 5000; // 5 seconds to Firebase
const unsigned long DISPLAY_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 1000; // 1 second display
```
